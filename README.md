# What is a blockchain podcast?

This is a list of all ongoing podcasts related to decentralized technologies.

To be included in this list, a media project must:
1. be a **podcast**, i.e., a feed of audio files available for subscription and offline consumption. A YouTube channel is not a podcast.
1. be mainly about **blockchain** (not a generic podcast on technology or economics with a single episode about Bitcoin).
1. have an episode released less than 3 months ago (at the time of inclusion into the list).


# Blockchain podcasts
